{% include counteventdetails.html %} 

<p>I started public speaking toward the end of August 2017 and thus far at <span class="bluenumber">{{ site.data.conferences.size}}</span> events, I've done <span class="bluenumber">{{talkcount}}</span> talks, and organised <span class="bluenumber">{{organisercount}}</span> of those, in a total of <span class="bluenumber">{{uniqueCountries.size}}</span> countries. Plus I've organised/co-organised many local meetups.
<p>If you're interested to know where I'm going to be and what events I'm attending, look no further! I will do my best to keep this up to date.</p>
<p>If you're interested in having me talk or help you organise an event, please contact me using your preferred method from my footer.</p>
