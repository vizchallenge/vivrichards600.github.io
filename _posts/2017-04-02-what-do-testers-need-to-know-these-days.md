title: What do testers need to know these days?
---

I'm currently a software developer and for the past year I have been looking to make the move in to a test role.

In my quest to move I've been trying to asses what testers are up to these days, what the requested skill set is etc. I was surprised by how many roles requested ISTQB on the job profile but when I got to interview it was just a box ticking exercise and actually the interviewers stated they don't really care about the qualification - they recommended the BCS Agile Testing or Rapid Software Testing!

In my quest to move disciplines I've also been really surprised by the number of companies who seek what I would consider fairly techy requirements. I work alongside some very talented QAs who've been testing for 5+ years and so asked them about some of the job adverts I had seen recently like the below:

> Desirable:
>
> * Experience testing web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and/or web services (REST, SOAP)
> * Experience with BDD, Cucumber
> * Coding automated tests with Java, JavaScript or similar languages. Experience with frameworks such as Protractor, Selenium Webdriver, > * REST Assured or similar
> * Experience with Continuous Integration / Delivery pipelines and tools such as Jenkins
> * Linux command-line / bash scripting or similar
> * They looked at me like I'd called them a very bad word... the above was quite alien to them.

Are companies being greedy and expecting to much or is this the natural shift in the QA world?

I was lucky enough to be offered the above role which unfortunately I had to turn down due to the travel but have since been offered two other lead test automation roles. In my attempt to switch from developer to tester I've applied for three jobs, all which have been offered to me but can't help but think if I hadn't come from a coding background I'd have struggled possibly?

It seems these days you need to be able to write or at least understand some basic html, css, javascript and possible get down to code level with Selenium Webdriver (which the last 5 jobs adverts I saw requested).

In each interview they ask some very basic testing questions (what is black box testing, white box, what is quality, boundary testing, regression etc..) and then it jumps quickly in to a very technical conversation. Is this because of my background or is this the way testing is going? I don't know?

I personally think testers need to be aware of what's going on in the dev world - go to meet-ups (www.meetup.com) or conferences (www.swanseacon.co.uk - sorry for the shameless plug :wink: ) and be aware of what's going on, read some blogs or belong to this awesome forum and see what people are talking about, play around with some basic html/css/javascript, maybe tinker with Selenium Webdriver or the recorder.
