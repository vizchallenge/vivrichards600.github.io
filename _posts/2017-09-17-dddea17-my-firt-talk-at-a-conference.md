### My first talk at a conference.

Today I had the pleasure of not only attending DDD East Anglia but also being invited to give my first conference talk. For those not in the know, DDD events are free to attend, happen on a Saturday and are pretty kick ass! Organisers and speakers all give up their free time to help make a great event happen, if you haven't checked out the DDD events what are you waiting for!? [DDD North](http://dddnorth.co.uk/) is up next month!

Back in June DDD East Anglia put out a call for speakers and admittedly after a few to many beers I decided to submit a talk and kind of forgot about it for a while... July the call for speakers opened. DDD let potential attendees vote on what should make the agenda - it's fantastic! As a speaker you know that before you that people want to know more about what you have to share.

Early August I got the fantastic news that I had some how managed to get on the the agenda, I would be giving a my first conference talk, a testing talk at a developer conference... yikes!

At this point I had never given a talk at a meet-up or conference - not even the meet-up I run ([Swansea Software Development Community](https://www.meetup.com/Swansea-Software-Development-Meetup/) or at a developer conference ([SwanseaCon](http://www.swanseacon.co.uk/)) which I've organised for 3 years - I'd usually do some introductions but never speak for 30+ minutes on a topic. I then discovered I'd overlooked one important piece of information... the talk length was one hour! 

In the run up to the event the meet-up I organise had not only one speaker drop out, but the speaker who then replaced the speaker who dropped out, also dropped out. I didn't really have much time to try and get some practise at speaking infront of people so this was my chance. I gave the talk at the meetup to around 14 people and it went down really well with the talk lasting 45 minutes. There were lots of questions and it helped me look at areas of my talk where I was lacking a little 'meat' to try and bulk the talk up a little. At work I was also asked to run the session in the front-end brown bag (lunch & learn) as well as the back-end developers chapter meeting, again the talk went down well and the feedback was fantastic which really helped with my confidence having never really done much public speaking.

A week away until DDD East Anglia I started to worry....what if people ask x or y, did I know enough about the subject?! I started to change things in the slide deck, expand on 'stuff'.... I started to feel a little like the flow and what I had rehearsed all of a sudden became something I didn't quite fully know how to deliver... this continued pretty much up until the day - I should have just left things as it just added to the panic!

On the day of the talk I was fortunate there was lunch before my talk, this gave me lots of time to plug my laptop in, run through my slides to ensure they displayed as expected and just run through a few things. Initially the thought of 'the grave yeard shift' (the session after lunch) did make me nervous, would people interact and stay awake?!

The attendees were excellent, they asked questions and were interested in the topics - after all at DDD events the attendees vote for the sessions to make the agenda and so of course they wanted to hear about what I had to say. The first 10 minutes I rushed through slides, luckily setting a timer on my watch enabled me to quickly adjust to slow down which really helped. I think having parts of the talk where attendees could interact worked well (spot the difference / where's wally), as well as ensuring attendees knew they could just comment or ask questions as we went along.

The whole experience was fantastic and I really enjoyed giving my first conference talk but I really need to work on slowing things down and perhaps speaking at a few other meet-ups before my talk at DDD North next month.

If you attended this session, thank you for being a part of it - I really hope you got something out of the talk and also had some fun.
